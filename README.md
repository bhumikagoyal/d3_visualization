# d3_visualization_outreachy
This is my project for the Outreachy internship.
I have used the feedback api to pull data from mozilla feedback site and made some visualizations to show percentage of happy and sad responses from users  in the last 1 week.
The visualizations are made using the d3 javascript library and can be viewed separately for each product,platform,versions etc.
