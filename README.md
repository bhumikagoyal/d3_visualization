# d3_visualization_outreachy
This is my project for the Outreachy internship.
I have used the feedback api to pull data from mozilla feedback site and made some visuaizations to show percentage of haapy and sad feedback from users in the last 1 week.
The visualizations are made using d3 javascript library .
